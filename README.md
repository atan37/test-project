# Hello, this is An (she/her/hers)

I am currently in my senior year at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Quantitative Analysis and minors in Statistics and Psychology. I believe in #techforgood, and am interested in any work that is related to data analysis or business analysis.

In my past experience as a data analyst and marketing intern at TEN Life Health Technology Corporation in Taiwan, I analyzed and visualized data to discover the effects of new healthcare product prior the official launch. I was also responsible for developing analytics by recognizing customerâ€™s behavior flow, website traffic and source through the use of Google Analytics.

When I am not working or studying, I like being outdoors (hiking, camping, travelling...), and also enjoy baking, cooking and listening to music. Specifically, catching sunset with a California Burrito is my all time favorite activity! :sunrise: Among all the places I have been to, my favorite spot in California is Big Sur :herb: :ocean:
